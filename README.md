# Work_Day_Scheduler

This work day schedule was made using Visual Studio Code with bootstrap as its main CSS framework. 

The main function behind this day planner is to allow users to input descriptions of an event within each timeblock. The webpage itself has the current day displayed at the top and below that are time blocks which range from 9am - 5pm. Each time block is automatically color-coded to notify the user as to whether the event in the past, present, or future. In the case that the page refreshes, the application allows the user to save the text for that event so that it continues to persist.
